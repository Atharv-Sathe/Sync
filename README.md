## About This Branch
This is the testing branch. The base branch which is also the default branch is main which is protected. <br>

This branch is also responsible for hosting the website. Hence any changes made to this branch would be reflected on the website.
Once the website is complete, the testing branch will be fully merged with the main branch. Hence all commits would 
first be made only to the testing branch.<br>

The testing branch will further have two sub-branches, 'front' and 'back'. The front end would be coded on the front branch while the back end would be integrated on the back branch. Once any changes are made the front branch will open a pull request to the testing branch, once approved the testing branch will have the latest front end code. This latest code would then be pulled by atharv sathe on his local machine who then merge the back branch to the testing branch, this would then be pushed to the testing branch on the remote repo. The testing will thus have the latest front and back code. Once entire website is finished the testing branch would be merged back to main branch.<br>
